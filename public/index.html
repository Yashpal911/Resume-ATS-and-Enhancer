            <h2>What does a resume parser do?</h2>
            <p>
                A resume parser scans your resume and extracts information about you and your background, such as what university you attended, what skills you have, and what job titles you’ve had

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Many employers use ATS with resume parsing features to quickly go through large amounts of applications and identify suitable applicants.</p>
            <br>

            <p>As a job seeker, by putting your resume through a parser before submitting your application, you can find and fix formatting errors that could make it difficult for ATS to scan your resume. This way, you ensure your qualifications are properly presented to employers.</p>
